Sonatype Nexus Installation
Pre-requisite
Create Redhat EC2 t2. medium Instance with 4GB RAM.
Create Security Group and open Required ports. 8081( For demo use All Traffic)
Attach Security Group to EC2 Instance.
Install java OpenJDK 1.8+ for Nexus version 3.15
# Step1
# If you run the command hostname it is going to give you ip-172-31-13-222.us-east-2.compute.internal
#If you run the command whoami the output will be ec2-user. Thus ec2-user is the user trying to run the script.
#As a good security practice, it is not advised to run Nexus service as a root user
# So, create a new user called nexus and grant sudo access to manage nexus services.
# Also set the time zone for the sonar server
sudo timedatectl set-timezone "America/Chicago"
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname nexus
#Now if you run the command hostname you should get nexus
#Now to add the user nexus run the command
sudo useradd nexus
# Grant sudo access to nexus user
sudo echo "nexus ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/nexus
#Now switch to the nexus user by running the command
sudo su - nexus
# Step2 (Install Java as a pre-requisite for nexus and other software)
# It is advised that all installations/downloads should be done in the opt directory
cd /opt
sudo yum install wget vim git unzip -y
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y

# Step3 (Download nexus software and extract it (unzip)
sudo wget http://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.15.2-01-unix.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf nexus-3.15.2-01-unix.tar.gz
Here's a breakdown of the above command:

sudo: This stands for "superuser do" and allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser (root) or another user, as specified by the security policy. It is often required for commands that need elevated privileges.

tar: This is a command-line utility that stands for "tape archive." It is used to create, maintain, modify, and extract files from an archive file.

-z: This option tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip. It is used for archives that have a .tar.gz or .tgz extension.

-x: This option stands for "extract," telling tar to extract the contents of the archive.

-v: This stands for "verbose," which means that tar will print the names of the files being processed to the terminal as it extracts them.

-f: This option indicates that the next argument will be the name of the archive file to operate on.
#Now remove the tar file by running the command
sudo rm -rf nexus-3.15.2-01-unix.tar.gz
sudo mv nexus-3.15.2-01 /opt/nexus

# Step4 (Grant permissions for nexus user to start and manage nexus service)
Now run the command ls a then ll 
You should get the directories nexus and sonatype-work 
# Now, who owns the above two files is the root user, not nexus user. 
# So, we are going to change the ownership to nexus and the file permissions
# Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/nexus and /opt/sonatype-work directories.
sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work
sudo chmod -R 775 /opt/nexus
sudo chmod -R 775 /opt/sonatype-work
#Now if you run the command ll, you will see that nexus owns the file
#Step5 
To ensure that nexus is run as the nexus user Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file and uncomment run_as_user parameter and set as nexus user. There are two options to do this. 
Option 1
To run as user nexus, sudo vim /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc     
You will note that it is listed as #run_as_user=""
Remove the #
Then between the “ ”you can input the name of the desired user(nexus).

Option 2
# You may also decide to use the CLI to change from #run_as_user="" to run_as_user="nexus” by using the command: -
echo run_as_user="nexus" > /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
#Now vim /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc  to see the user name changed to nexus

#Step6
Start the nexus service:
sh /opt/nexus/bin/nexus start
Check the nexus service status:
sh /opt/nexus/bin/nexus status


#Step6 (CONFIGURE NEXUS TO RUN AS A SERVICE)
Now if you run the command sudo systemctl start nexus the result will be a fail because nexus has not been configured as a service. To configure it, we need to create a symbolic link to start nexus.
sudo ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus

# Now to enable Nexus service
sudo systemctl enable nexus
# To start nexus
sudo systemctl start nexus
# To check if Nexus is running
sudo systemctl status nexus
